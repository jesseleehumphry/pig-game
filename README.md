Repository for learning project titled "Pig Game".

Pig Game is a learning project provided by Jonas Schmedtmann in his Udemy course.
While this game takes most elements from the files provided in that course, I'm going to be making additions and changes separately to give the game my own visual flavor and functionality. 


### What's done in the course


V 0.0.1 and the addition of a "winner" screen are all the course teaches or achieves for this particular project. Any additional functions will have been added due to my curiosity. 


### What's planned

- Rich feedback on numbers increasing in both the "pocket" and in the "bank". 
- Sexier transitions from one active player to the other
- "Danger Roll" win condition, where a player can win by having the max points rolled in the "pocket".
- Better animations for the "losing" roll.
- Multiple game modes



#### Game Modes

- Odds and evens
  - A game mode where even numbers are worth double, odd numbers are worth half.
- d20
  - Uses a 20-sided die instead, wit 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 being the "losing" rolls.
- Hotline
  - Uses a 6-sided die, but the limit must be matched EXACTLY in order to win.
